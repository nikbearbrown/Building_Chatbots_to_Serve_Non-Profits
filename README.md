# Best Practices for Building Chatbots and Visualizing Non-Profit Data

**1. Introduction**
Chatbots have become increasingly prevalent in various sectors, including healthcare, education, customer service, and non-profits. Their ability to provide immediate, automated responses makes them valuable tools for enhancing user experience and accessibility. This survey reviews the literature on best practices for designing chatbots, particularly in mental healthcare, ethical AI design, higher education, and open-domain applications, while also exploring effective data visualization techniques for non-profits.

**2. Best Practices for Designing Chatbots**

**2.1 User-Centered Design in Mental Healthcare**
Cameron et al. (2018) outline the development of the iHelpr chatbot, emphasizing its role in administering self-assessment instruments and providing well-being guidance within a conversational interface. The study highlights the importance of engaging users early in the design process to create a system that meets their specific needs and preferences. Key features include guided self-assessment on stress, anxiety, depression, and the integration of external APIs like Open Weather Map to enhance conversational flow and user engagement.

**2.2 Ethical Design in AI Systems**
Bang et al. (2021) discuss the necessity of ethical guidelines in AI systems to mitigate the negative effects of biased data and unethical conversations. They review general ethical guidelines such as transparency, explainability, predictability, accountability, fairness, privacy, and control. The paper emphasizes the importance of designing chatbots that adhere to these principles to prevent potential social losses and maintain user trust.

**2.3 Design Knowledge for Higher Education**
Sjöström et al. (2018) employ design science research to develop a conceptual architecture for chatbots in higher education. They provide design recommendations based on a literature review and a proof-of-concept implementation. The study underscores the value of involving educational stakeholders throughout the development process to ensure the chatbot addresses the specific needs of students and faculty.

### Survey Paper Section: Best Practices for Data Visualizations and Their Impact on User Comprehension and Engagement

**1. Introduction**
Data visualizations have become a pivotal tool for conveying complex information in an accessible and engaging manner. This survey explores the best practices in designing data visualizations, emphasizing cultural sensitivity, usability, and effective communication. The section also reviews the impact of visualizations on user comprehension and engagement, particularly in health and societal contexts.

**2. Best Practices for Data Visualizations**

**2.1 Culturally Sensitive Data Visualizations**
Gendron et al. (2016) highlight the importance of understanding cultural differences when designing data visualizations for a global audience. The paper proposes best practices by analyzing cultural traits and communication habits between Western and Eastern regions. It emphasizes the need for managers to create visualizations that minimize cultural bias and support timely, accurate decision-making. This approach is crucial for organizations competing in a global business environment where cultural sensitivity can significantly impact the effectiveness of visual communications.

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "Organizations are undergoing significant changes in their business environment."
- "Competing on a global scale means that organizations must better understand cultural issues of their customers, employees, and key stakeholders."
- "When creating culturally sensitive data visualizations, a set of best practices is required to assist managers to make timely and accurate decisions with the least possible cultural bias."
- "This article aims to develop these best practices by analyzing cultural traits, communication habits, and other differences between the western and eastern global regions."

**2.2 Usability in Data Visualizations**
Mirel (1998) critically reviews the usability concerns associated with data visualizations, pointing out limitations in the literature primarily authored by computing specialists. The paper calls for additional usability studies to address gaps from an object-oriented perspective. It argues that the current computer science orientation is insufficient for supporting users in critical areas such as sophisticated visual literacy and complex data analysis. By involving technical communicators with expertise in rhetoric and situated activities, the paper suggests that more comprehensive usability studies can be conducted to fill existing gaps.

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "Data visualization has been called the 'killer app' of the 1990s."
- "It is a powerful tool for exploring and analyzing data—for discovering as well as testing hypotheses."
- "The prevailing computer science orientation to data visualizations is severely limited for addressing many of the usability concerns associated with supporting users in three critical problem areas—sophisticated visual literacy, complex data analysis, and new paradigms of visual inquiry."
- "My aim is to prompt technical communicators—with their expertise in rhetoric and situated activities—to conduct additional usability studies that will fill in the current gaps occasioned by a dominant object-oriented perspective."

**2.3 Data Visualization in Health Contexts**
Melonçon and Warner (2017) discuss the need for an integrative literature review on data visualizations in health and medical contexts. Their findings suggest a lack of consensus on the best visualization methods for lay audiences. They identify emerging effective practices such as pictographs, icon arrays, and bar charts, while emphasizing the importance of simplicity. The paper also highlights specific research areas where further empirical studies are needed to improve the comprehension of complex health data among lay audiences.

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "Integrative literature review on data visualizations, particularly in health and medical contexts."
- "Findings suggest there is little agreement on the best way to visualize complex data for lay audiences."
- "Pictographs, icon arrays, and bar charts seem to hold promise for comprehension by users."
- "Visualizations need to be kept as simple as possible with attention to integrating other design features such as headings and legends."
- "Five specific research areas in which technical and professional communicators should focus their attention on empirical studies."

**2.4 Human Comprehension of Data Visualizations**
Haass et al. (2016) address challenges in data visualization by comparing saliency models and emphasizing the need for new models to enhance visual search. They highlight that human visual processing involves both bottom-up and top-down attention processes. The study compares the performance of different saliency models to establish a baseline for assessing new models. It also explores the role of expertise in how viewers navigate and process data visualizations, suggesting that more effective models can improve comprehension and decision-making.

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "Modeling Human Comprehension of Data Visualizations."
- "A critical challenge in data science is conveying the meaning of data to human decision makers."
- "While working with visualizations, decision makers are engaged in a visual search for information to support their reasoning process."
- "The volume of data decision makers must contend with is growing continuously and driving the need for more efficient and effective data visualizations."
- "Researchers across the fields of data science, visualization, and human-computer interaction are calling for foundational tools and principles to assess the effectiveness of data visualizations."
- "We compare the performance of three different saliency models across a common set of data visualizations to establish a performance baseline for assessment of new data visualization saliency models."

**3. Conclusion**
The surveyed papers provide valuable insights into best practices for designing effective data visualizations, with a focus on cultural sensitivity, usability, and user comprehension. Understanding cultural traits, addressing usability concerns, simplifying complex data, and improving saliency models are essential steps to enhance the effectiveness of data visualizations. As the field continues to evolve, ongoing research and interdisciplinary collaboration will be crucial to developing visualizations that are both informative and engaging for diverse audiences.
